 Refactoring the stocks data analysis code to compare yearly return percentage and formatting the results with VBA.

# Overview of Project
This project is an assignmnet from Data Analytics program - VBA Module<br>
- Deliverable 1:  Refactor VBA code and measure performance<br>
  This deliverable will include an updated workbook and a folder with PNGs of the pop-ups with script run time <br>
   

# Results
Both 2017 and 2018 refactored code process time is faster than the original code. 
Array is applied instead of pulling cells from data for loop, which has shorten the time for the code system.
